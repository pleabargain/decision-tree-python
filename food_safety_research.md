# Food Safety Evaluation Research

This document contains research on food safety evaluation frameworks and decision trees, which informed the creation of our sample decision tree.

## Core Decision Tree Structure

### 1. Hazard Identification
   - **Key Question:** *What biological, chemical, or physical hazards are reasonably likely to occur in the process/product?*  
     - **Context:** Conduct hazard analysis by reviewing ingredients, processes, and historical data (e.g., outbreaks).  
     - **Tools:** FDA hazard analysis worksheets, ISO 22000 guidelines.

### 2. Critical Control Point (CCP) Determination  
Use the **Codex CCP Decision Tree** (revised 2023):  
1. **Question 1:** *Can the hazard be controlled by prerequisite programs (e.g., GHPs) at this step?*  
   - **If YES:** Not a CCP (control via GHPs).  
   - **If NO:** Proceed to Question 2.  

2. **Question 2:** *Are specific control measures for the hazard in place here?*  
   - **If NO:** Modify the process and restart analysis.  
   - **If YES:** Proceed to Question 3.  

3. **Question 3:** *Will a subsequent step eliminate/reduce the hazard to acceptable levels?*  
   - **If YES:** Not a CCP.  
   - **If NO:** Proceed to Question 4.  

4. **Question 4:** *Can this step specifically control the hazard to acceptable levels?*  
   - **If YES:** Designate as CCP.  
   - **If NO:** Modify process and restart analysis.  

**Provisos to consider:**  
- Hazard severity and likelihood.  
- Combined control measures across steps (e.g., temperature + pH).  
- Documentation of decisions (e.g., CCP determination worksheets).  

## Risk Prioritization & Control  
### Hierarchical criteria for risk ranking:  
1. **Public health impact** (e.g., acute/chronic toxicity).  
2. **Economic feasibility** (cost of controls vs. risk reduction).  
3. **Consumer perception** (allergen risks, cultural preferences).  
4. **Regulatory compliance** (FDA/FSMA, Codex standards).  

**Tools:**  
- **Risk matrices** (quantitative scoring of severity × likelihood).  
- **Multi-factor decision frameworks** (FAO/WHO guidelines).  

## Monitoring & Verification  
- **Key Questions:**  
  - *Are critical limits (e.g., temperature, pH) measurable and validated?*
  - *Is monitoring frequency sufficient to detect deviations?*
- **Actions:**  
  - Document corrective actions for deviations.  
  - Use verification procedures (audits, microbial testing).  

## Adaptive Management  
- **Review triggers:**  
  - Process changes (e.g., new ingredients, equipment).  
  - Emerging hazards (e.g., novel pathogens).
- **Tools:**  
  - Iterative updates to HACCP plans.  
  - Integration of machine learning for risk prediction (e.g., FADM models).  

## Contextual Considerations  
- **Small businesses:** Simplified decision trees (e.g., Cornell Agricultural Water Decision Tree).  
- **Global standards:** Alignment with Codex, ISO 22000, or GFSI-benchmarked schemes.  
- **Documentation:** Justify decisions using scientific evidence (e.g., FDA's hazard analysis worksheets).  

## Key Food Safety Parameters

### Temperature Control
- **Cold Storage:** Below 40°F (4°C) for refrigerated items
- **Freezer Storage:** Below 0°F (-18°C) for frozen items
- **Danger Zone:** 40°F to 140°F (4°C to 60°C) where bacteria multiply rapidly
- **Maximum Time in Danger Zone:** 2 hours (1 hour if ambient temperature is above 90°F/32°C)

### Cooking Temperatures
- **Poultry, Stuffed Meats:** 165°F (74°C)
- **Ground Meats:** 160°F (71°C)
- **Whole Cuts of Beef, Pork, Fish:** 145°F (63°C)
- **Eggs:** Cook until yolk and white are firm

### Cross-Contamination Prevention
- Separate raw and cooked foods
- Use different cutting boards and utensils for raw meats and ready-to-eat foods
- Wash hands, utensils, and surfaces after contact with raw foods

### Personal Hygiene
- Wash hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and warm water
- Avoid food preparation when ill
- Cover cuts with waterproof bandages and wear gloves

### Storage Guidelines
- Use clean, sealed containers
- Store raw meats on bottom shelves to prevent dripping
- Follow FIFO (First In, First Out) principle

### Allergen Management
- Identify common allergens (milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soybeans)
- Prevent cross-contact during preparation
- Clearly label foods containing allergens
